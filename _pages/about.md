# üòÉ Brief Bio
Hi! Welcome to the personal page of Kaiqi. I was born in Foshan, Guangdong, China in 1996. I obtained PhD degree from Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Weiping Wang](https://wanglab.org). 

My research interest includes photochemistry, ocular drug delivery, molecular self-assembly, optical devices, etc.

I will join Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School as postdoctoral fellow in Feb 2024. I will work on nucleic acid delivery there with Prof. Jinjun Shi.

If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation with me, please feel free to contact me at [longkq@hku.hk](longkq@hku.hk).

For more details, please refer to my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf). (last updated: Dec 2, 2023)
